## IDEs

* I admire VS Code and its simple yet extensible feature.
  * but when I was starting out Java Extension had a lot of bugs most prominent one was not able to create a
    file without a package. But the arrow buttons on my keyboard are really small, so it makes the navigation painful.
  * Just today I try to auto-indent a code with lambdas, and the result was not pleasing.
* Eclipse: Long time to load and no good dark theme last time I used.
* IntelliJ Idea:
  * Interface was nice but as Guido van Rossum said when comparing PyCharm and Emacs "its like driving a 18 Wheeler truck....", and was too overwhelming.
  * And JetBrains really lining the bottom-line with having a different for every different language!! As a low earning individual I can't really afford that.
  * Was trying to install Fleet, but put off by pre-requisite to install JetBrains ToolBar.
  * Also as a Linux user, I am quite angry that they package it as 'snap' and not 'flatpak'.
* NeoVim:
    I just love its keybindings. Because of this, I started using Vimium in my browser, I have even started using Vim binding on HackerRank and Leetcode(quite a buggy implementation) and couldn't be more happier.
* Emacs: Haha, nice try. Not going down that hole.

#### Verdict

* Going to use VS-Code initially  and then gradually switch to IntelliJ.
* But I am going to try my best to use Vim Bindings when editing.
* Integrate and Follow Google Java Stylesheet.
