# `for` loops

**Note:** For loops are much better than while loops(when you have a choice)

## 3 components of `for` loops

1. initialization of loop-ctrl var (initialization)
2. Test condition
3. Loop end statements (generally Update(increase, decrease) loop-ctrl var)

`for (initialization; condition; update)`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  ...
}
```

**Note:** All these components are optional.

`for(;;)`
